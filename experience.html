	<h2>Teater BAHASA at AEON Mall Seri Manjung</h2>
	<p>In 2016, I was once enter a teater BAHASA at AEON Mall Seri Manjung but did not win any place. We also did not take a whole group of photo because of a certain problem at that moment even I can't remember. The whole competition is a good experience to me. I come to know that even though my group did our best but others competitor also showing their best. The only photo that I manage to take is in the bus to the competition place. </p>

	<h2>Kawad Kaki Competition</h2>
	<p>In 2016, I also involved in Pertandingan Kawad Kaki but only in school level. I learn that through foot marching skills can make students be more discipline and will learn to listen instructions better. A high discipline that was nurtured during the training was able to educate individual to be more focused to what their gonna achieved. The photo below is my whole team for the Kawad Kaki Competition. My team also was called Kavanas Squad because we from 99 batch.</p>
